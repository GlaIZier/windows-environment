# Ansible Windows environment initializer for home usage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GlaIZier/windows-environment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GlaIZier/windows-environment)

Todo move to chocolatey script (https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1286, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4165387/create-folder-with-batch-but-only-if-it-doesnt-already-exist) as Ansible have problems with Windows: required to RM to be install on (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html#authentication-options) and it's difficult to install it on a control machine.

## What does it do
1. Installs applications by chocolatey (chrome... check the full list in the config)
2. Creates directories for different purposes

## Why not Ansible
TBD

## Dependencies
no

## Installation
Install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation)
TBD

  Install Ansible on the same Windows machine, which could be tricky, or install it on a Linux machine and change inventory file to control a Windows machine remotely. 
### Installation on Windows
Install chocolatey

## Run
In powershell
```./run.bat <path to folder to be created> (C:\Users\user)```

TBD
### Run all tasks
`ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K` inside this directory. Enter your account password when prompted. \
### Run separate tasks
Filter by tags can be used: `ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory -K --tags "dotfiles,homebrew"` \
Or update the config to disable some tasks, e.g. `configure_homebrew: no` \
By using these strategies you can execute tasks one by one.


## Config
You can always add additional packages to packages.config
 
## Idempotence
This script is idempotent
